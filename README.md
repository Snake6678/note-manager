# Note Manager

Note Manager is a lightweight Python application that allows you to create, edit, delete, and export notes. It offers both a command-line interface and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter`. Notes are stored locally using SQLite.

This version includes voice-to-text note entry and basic math expression evaluation using SymPy.

## Features

- Add notes with title and body
- Edit existing notes by selecting them from the list
- Scrollable list of saved notes
- Delete notes by title
- Export notes to JSON or CSV format
- Desktop GUI built with tkinter
- Voice recognition for note input (speech-to-text)
- Evaluate math expressions written in notes (e.g., `sqrt(16) + 3^2`)
- Works offline with no login or cloud required

##  License Key

To generate your license key, run:

```

Replace `'your@email.com'` with your real email.
